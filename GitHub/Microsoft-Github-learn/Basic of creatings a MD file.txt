To create an ordered list in a GitHub Markdown file, you can:
Start each line with a number
Follow the number with a period
Follow the period with a space 
The order of the numbers doesn't matter, and they don't need to be sequential. You can also use any of * , + or - to make a list. Each list must consistently use the same character, and a space is required after each list character. 
To create a nested section of a list, you can add two spaces before the bullet or number character. Lists must have an empty line above and below to separate them from adjacent paragraphs. 
You can also create an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - , * , or +.
