The git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME> command is used to push the changes from your local repository to a remote repository and set the local branch to track the remote branch. Here’s a breakdown:

- git push: This is the command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- --set-upstream (or -u for short): This flag tells Git to link the local branch with the remote branch so that in the future, you can simply type git push or git pull without specifying the branch.
- origin: This is the default name Git gives to the remote repository where you cloned from. It’s essentially a shorthand name for the remote repository’s URL.
- <BRANCH_NAME>: This is the name of your branch. You replace <BRANCH_NAME> with the name of the branch that you want to push.

So, when you type git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>, you’re saying “Hey Git, push my changes to the branch named <BRANCH_NAME> on the origin remote repository. And also, set my local <BRANCH_NAME> branch to track the remote <BRANCH_NAME> branch from now on.”

This command is typically used when you’ve just created a new branch locally and you want to push it to the remote repository for the first time. After running this command once, you can use git push and git pull for the branch without specifying the branch name.
