You can find D3.js documentation at https://d3js.org/. You can also find installation documentation at https://d3js.org/getting-started. 
You can also find documentation for older versions of D3 on GitHub.

To link to the latest version of D3.js, you can use the following snippet: 
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script> 
 
D3.js, or Data-Driven Documents, is a JavaScript library that creates dynamic data visualizations for web browsers. 
  It uses HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standards. 
  
Here are some steps for creating a D3 app: 
Set up the environment
Create an HTML file
Create a JavaScript file
Load data
Create visualizations
To embed D3 in HTML, you can: 
Add basic tags like html, head, and body
Include the d3 JavaScript in a script tag with src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"
Add your code above into another script and the end of the body tag

You can also include the D3 library from CDN by linking it directly into your HTML page. 
A CDN is a network of servers that hosts files and delivers them to a user based on their location. 
Using a CDN means you don't need to download the source code.


Why use CDN for JavaScript?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. 
A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
