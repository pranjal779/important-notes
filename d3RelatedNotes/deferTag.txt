The defer attribute in the script tag tells the browser to defer the execution of the script until the page has finished parsing. 
This can be useful for scripts that are not essential for the initial rendering of the page, as it can improve the page load time.
For example, a script that adds analytics tracking to a page can be deferred, as the page can still be rendered and used without the tracking data. 
Once the page has finished loading, the deferred script will be executed and the analytics data will be collected.
The defer attribute can also be used for scripts that are dependent on other scripts. 
For example, a script that adds a social media sharing button to a page may need to wait for the social media scripts to be loaded before it can be executed. 
By deferring the execution of the social media sharing script, the browser can ensure that all of the necessary scripts are loaded before the button is added to the page.
It is important to note that the defer attribute does not prevent the browser from downloading the script. The script will still be downloaded in parallel with the parsing of the page. 
However, the script will not be executed until the page has finished parsing.

Here is an example of how to use the defer attribute:

<script defer src="/Bar-Charts/script.js"></script>

In this example, the script at the specified URL will be deferred until the page has finished parsing.
