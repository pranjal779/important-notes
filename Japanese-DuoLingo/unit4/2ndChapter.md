My word!
To say something belongs to you, use the phrase 
わたしの
 [watashi no]:
これはわたしのかさです。

[kore wa watashi no kasa desu]
This is my umbrella.
More than one
Japanese uses the same word whether you are talking about one thing or more than one. For example, 
くつ
 kutsu can mean either shoe or shoes! Other words in the sentence might help you know if you’re talking about more than one thing. Here’s an example:
これらはわたしのくつです。

[korera wa watashi no kutsu desu]
These are my shoes.
However, some sentences can have more than one translation:
わたしのくつです。

[watashi no kutsu desu]
It's my shoe. / They're my shoes




はhaいi わwaたtaしshiのno かkaさsa はwa あaかkaいi でdeすsu
Yes, my umbrella is red.
