MULTI-VARIABLE DECLARATION
We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:

sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
Copy icon
Which is the same as:

sword_name = "Excalibur"
sword_damage = 10
sword_length = 200
Copy icon
Any number of variables can be declared on the same line, and variables declared on the same line should be related to one another in some way 
so that the code remains easy to understand.

We call code that's easy to understand "clean code".
