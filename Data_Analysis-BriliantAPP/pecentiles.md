What is the median amount of minutes a country spends on leisure? 
Step 1: Determine the total number of countries 
The height of each bar represents the number of countries. [1]  

• 100-200 minutes: 1 country 
• 200-300 minutes: 3 countries 
• 300-400 minutes: 15 countries 
• 400+ minutes: 1 country 

Total number of countries = $1 + 3 + 15 + 1 = 20$ 
Step 2: Find the position of the median 
The median is the middle value in a dataset. For an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The positions of the two middle values are $\frac{20}{2} = 10$ and $\frac{20}{2} + 1 = 11$. Therefore, the median is the average of the 10th and 11th values. 
Step 3: Locate the median in the histogram 

• The first bar (100-200 minutes) contains the 1st value. 
• The second bar (200-300 minutes) contains the 2nd to 4th values $1+3=4$). 
• The third bar (300-400 minutes) contains the 5th to 19th values $4+15=19$). 

Since both the 10th and 11th values fall within the 300-400 minutes range, the median must be within this range. The only option provided that falls within this range is 298. 
Answer: 
The median amount of minutes a country spends on leisure is 298.

75th Percentile of Leisure Time 
Step 1: Analyze the histogram to determine the total number of countries. 
The y-axis represents the number of countries. 

• The first bar (100-200 minutes) represents 1 country. 
• The second bar (200-300 minutes) represents 3 countries. 
• The third bar (300-400 minutes) represents 13 countries. 
• The fourth bar (400+ minutes) represents 1 country. 

Total number of countries = $1 + 3 + 13 + 1 = 18$ 
Step 2: Calculate the position of the 75th percentile. 
The 75th percentile is the value below which 75% of the observations may be found. Position of the 75th percentile = $0.75 \times 18 = 13.5$ 
Step 3: Find the leisure time corresponding to the 13.5th country. 
We need to find which bar the 13.5th country falls into. 

• The first bar contains the 1st country. 
• The second bar contains the 2nd to 4th countries $1+3=4$). 
• The third bar contains the 5th to 17th countries $4+13=17$). 

The 13.5th country is within the third bar, which corresponds to the leisure time of 300-400 minutes. The value in the middle of this range is 350. 
Answer: 
The 75th percentile amount of minutes a country spends on leisure is approximately 350.
