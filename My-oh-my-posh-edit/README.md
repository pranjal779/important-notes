# Fixing Conda/Python Environment Display in oh-my-posh (VS Code Terminal)

## Issue
While using **oh-my-posh** with PowerShell inside **Visual Studio Code**, the Python/Conda environment name was not displaying correctly in the terminal prompt.  

- The **execution time diamond** (`< >`) had proper edges, but the **environment diamond** only showed `<<` at the end instead of `< >`.  
- This made the conda environment display look broken compared to other segments.  

---

## Files Touched
1. **oh-my-posh configuration file** (JSON)  
   - Path: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\themes\...json`  
   - This file controls the prompt theme.

---

## Changes Made
1. Edited the **Python block** in the oh-my-posh config (my final edit):  

```json
   {
      "background": "#516BEB",
      "foreground": "#ffffff",
      "leading_diamond": "\ue0b2",
      "properties": {
        "display_mode": "environment",
        "fetch_virtual_env": true
      },
      "style": "diamond",
      "template": " {{ if .Venv }}({{ .Venv }}){{ end }} ",
      "trailing_diamond": "\ue0b0",
      "type": "python"
    }
````

* `{{ if ne .EnvironmentName "base" }}{{ .EnvironmentName }}{{ end }}` ensures that the environment name shows only if it’s not `base`.
* ` {{ .Full }}` adds the Python logo and full version.

2. Restarted **VS Code** and the **terminal** to apply changes.

---

## Commands Used

* To reload oh-my-posh config:

  ```powershell
  oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\custom.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
  ```

* To check conda environments:

  ```powershell
  conda env list
  ```

---

## Outcome

✅ Python/Conda environment name now shows correctly.
✅ Execution time and environment segments both render with proper `< >` edges.

but I wanted better edges:

## Notes for Future

* Always restart VS Code after modifying the **.omp.json** file.
* Keep a backup of the theme JSON before making changes.
* If the environment segment looks broken, check the **template syntax** in the config.
