What Is PySpark RDD? Resilient Distributed Datasets, often known as RDDs, are the components used in a cluster's parallel processing
that run and operate across numerous nodes. Since RDDs are immutable elements, you cannot alter them after creation.
Because RDDs are fault-tolerant, they will immediately recover from any failure. These RDDs allow you to do various operations to complete a certain goal.
