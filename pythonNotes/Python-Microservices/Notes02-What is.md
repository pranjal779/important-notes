Not exactly â€” but you're close. Here's the difference:

---

### ðŸ”¹ What Microservices **Are**:

* **Microservices** are a design pattern or architectural style.
* You build an application as a **collection of small, independent services**, each doing **one specific thing**.
* These services talk to each other using APIs (usually **REST** or **gRPC** over HTTP).

---

### ðŸ”¸ Microservices **vs** APIs:

| Concept          | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**          | A way for different software components to **communicate** (interface).       |
| **Microservice** | A **self-contained unit** of an app that has its own code, database, and API. |
| â†’ Uses API       | Yes. Microservices **expose** APIs to let other services talk to them.        |

### âœ… Example:

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re building an e-commerce app:

* One microservice handles **user authentication**
* One handles **product catalog**
* One handles **payment processing**

Each microservice:

* Has its own codebase
* Can be built with **different languages** (Python, Java, Go, etc.)
* Communicates via API

Would you like me to now break down:

1. How Python is used in microservices
2. How AWS supports microservices
3. A roadmap to learn microservices step by step?

Let me know if you want all 3 or just specific ones.
