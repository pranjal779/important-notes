The output is [1, -2, -3]. Letâ€™s break it down:

The list l contains the elements [1, -2, -3, 4, 5].
The function f1(x) returns True if x is less than 2, and False otherwise.
The filter(f1, l) function applies f1 to each element in l and returns an iterator containing only the elements for which f1 returns True.
The list(m1) converts the filtered iterator to a list.
Hereâ€™s how it works:

f1(1) returns True, so 1 is included in the filtered result.
f1(-2) returns True, so -2 is included.
f1(-3) returns True, so -3 is included.
The other elements (4 and 5) do not satisfy the condition, so they are excluded.
Therefore, the output is [1, -2, -3]. ğŸ˜Š
