Preparing for a Python job interview involves not only technical knowledge but also the ability to handle behavioral questions. Here are some examples of behavioral interview questions that you might encounter:

1) Can you describe a challenging problem you faced while working on a Python project and how you overcame it?  
2) How do you stay motivated and productive when working on long-term projects?  
Tell me about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.  
Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.  
Describe a situation where you had to learn a new technology or framework to complete a task. How did you approach it?  
These questions assess your soft skills, mindset, and past experiences. Itâ€™s important to reflect on your experiences and prepare stories that highlight your problem-solving abilities, teamwork, adaptability, and learning mindset. Remember to focus on specific situations, the actions you took, and the outcomes of those actions. Good luck with your interview preparation!
