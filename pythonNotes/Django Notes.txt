in the django documentation

from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

what is meant by from.inport views

In the code snippet you provided, from . import views is a Python statement that imports the views module from the current package. In Django, a package is a directory containing a file called __init__.py. The . in the statement represents the current package.

So, if the views.py file is located in the same directory as urls.py, then from . import views will import the views module defined in views.py. Once imported, the views module can be accessed using the dot notation, for example views.index.

The path statement below it creates a URL pattern that maps the empty string ('') to the index function defined in views.py.
