do we have to write any code or any simpler file like Dockerfile for kubernetes?

Yes, you typically need to write a Kubernetes manifest file to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster. 
The manifest file is a YAML or JSON file that describes the desired state of the application and the resources it requires, 
such as containers, volumes, services, and deployments.

The manifest file contains several sections that define the configuration of the application, including:

apiVersion: specifies the API version that the manifest uses.
kind: specifies the kind of object that the manifest describes, such as Deployment, Service, or ConfigMap.
metadata: contains metadata about the object, such as its name, labels, and annotations.
spec: contains the specification of the object, including its configuration, containers, volumes, and other resources.
Here is an example manifest file for a simple web application:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: my-registry-secret
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer


This manifest file defines a Deployment that will run three replicas of a container called myapp with the image myapp:latest, exposing port 80. 
It also defines a Service that exposes port 80 and routes traffic to the Deployment. In addition, it specifies that the container image requires a pull secret 
called my-registry-secret.

Once you have created the manifest file, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to apply it to your Kubernetes cluster and deploy the application:

Copy code
kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml
This will create the necessary resources in your Kubernetes cluster and start the application. You can monitor the status of the resources using 
kubectl get commands, and you can modify the manifest file and reapply it to update the configuration of the application.
