To determine which Python module you need to use, you can refer to the Python documentation, check websites such as stackoverflow, 
check the specific problem statement or use case you are trying to solve, and search for relevant modules. 
You can also try searching for the module on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and read its documentation and 
user reviews to understand its functionality and if it fits your needs. 
It is also recommended to read through the official documentation for each module to understand its capabilities, limitations, and how to use it effectively.
