after a pull request (PR) is merged, create a Git tag to mark the branch as closed. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, ensure that you have the latest changes by performing a `git pull`:

   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Create a Git tag to mark the branch as closed. You can use the following command:

   ```
   git tag -a closed-<branchName> -m "Closed branch <branchName>"
   ```

   Replace `<branchName>` with the actual name of the branch. This command creates an annotated tag with a message indicating that the branch is closed.

3. Push the tag to the remote repository:

   ```
   git push origin closed-<branchName>
   ```

   This command pushes the tag to the remote repository, making it visible to other contributors.

By creating a Git tag, you provide a clear indication that the branch is closed, allowing you and others to reference it later for historical purposes. The tag will remain in the repository even after the branch is deleted or merged.


afterwards delete the branch locally:
git branch -d <branchName>

Optionally, you can also delete the remote branch if you no longer need it:
git push origin --delete <branchName>
