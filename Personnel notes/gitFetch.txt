The git
 fetch command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository
 into your local repository. It does not merge the changes into your current branch, but it does update the tracking branches. 
 This means that you can see the changes that have been made on the remote repository, but you have to explicitly merge them into your local branch before you can start working on them.

There are a few reasons why you might want to use git fetch:
To see what changes have been made on the remote repository: If you're working on a branch that is not up-to-date, 
you can use git fetch to see what changes have been made on the remote repository. 
This can help you to decide whether you need to merge the changes into your local branch.

To update your tracking branches: If you're working on a branch that is tracking a remote branch, you can use git fetch to update your local tracking branch. 
This will ensure that you always have the latest changes from the remote repository.
To prepare for a merge: If you're planning to merge a branch into your current branch, you can use git fetch to update your local copy of the branch that you're merging. 
This will help to avoid any merge conflicts.

Here are some examples of when you might want to use git fetch:
You're working on a feature branch and you want to see if anyone else has made any changes to the main branch since you started working on your feature branch.
You're working on a team and you want to make sure that your local copy of the code is always up-to-date with the latest changes from your teammates.
You're planning to merge a branch into your current branch and you want to make sure that you have the latest changes from the remote branch.
