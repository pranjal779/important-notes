I see some stacks are python based but they do have React which is javascript, why is that? why is it needed in a python stack
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is often used in combination with a Python backend because 
the two technologies complement each other well.

Python is great for server-side processing and handling data, while JavaScript is ideal for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. 
When used together, Python and React can create a complete web application with a rich frontend and a robust backend.

Moreover, React provides a large developer community and a lot of resources and tools to help you build your application quickly and efficiently. 
Therefore, even if a stack is primarily built with Python, it may still use JavaScript for certain tasks, such as creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.



can you give me names of few important stacks
Sure, here are a few popular tech stacks:

MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js)
MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
Django (Python, Django, JavaScript, SQLite)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, SQLite)
.NET (C#, .NET, SQL Server)
MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js)




is FReMP Stack a good stack?
FReMP is not a well-known technology stack. It's possible that you're referring to the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), 
which is a popular open-source web development stack, but there's not enough information to determine whether the FReMP stack is a 
good one or not without further context.



I mean Flask React Mongo Python - FReMP Stack
The FReMP stack (Flask, React, MongoDB, and Python) can be a good choice for certain web development projects, 
as it combines the benefits of Flask for the back-end (server-side) and React for the front-end (client-side). 
MongoDB can provide a scalable and flexible solution for data storage. However, the suitability of the FReMP stack for a 
specific project depends on the requirements and constraints of the project.



so which stack do you recommend FReMP Stack or Django?
It depends on the use case and project requirements. Both Flask and Django are good for building web applications, 
but Django is a full-featured framework that can handle complex projects, while Flask is a micro framework that is better suited for small to medium sized projects 
or for serving as a backend for a JavaScript-based frontend. If you want to build an application with a Python backend and a React frontend, 
the FReMP stack could be a good choice. However, ultimately the choice of stack will depend on your specific needs and preferences.
