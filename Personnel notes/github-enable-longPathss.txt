run the command `git config --global core.longpaths true`, you are setting the `core.longpaths` configuration to `true` at the global (user) level. This means that Git should now be configured to allow longer file paths.

To confirm that it has been set correctly, you can check the Git configuration by running the following command:

```bash
git config --global --get core.longpaths
```

If it's set correctly, it should return `true`, indicating that the `core.longpaths` configuration is enabled at the global level.
