1. If either `a` or `b` is less than 0, the function should return `undefined` immediately. You don't need to perform any calculations in this case.

2. If both `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to 0, you should calculate and return the result as it currently does.

Here's the modified `abTest` function:

```javascript
function abTest(a, b) {
  // Check if either a or b is less than 0
  if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
    return undefined; // Return undefined immediately
  }

  // Calculate and return the result for non-negative values of a and b
  return Math.round(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(a) + Math.sqrt(b), 2));
}
```

This code first checks if `a` or `b` is less than 0. If either of them is less than 0, it immediately returns `undefined`. If both `a` and `b` are non-negative, it proceeds with the calculation and returns the result. 
  This way, the function stops execution early when one of the input values is negative.
