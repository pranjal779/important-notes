can you give me a detailed schedule for frontend technologies and before that can you tell me is there any famous stacks in frontend as well if so can you name a few of them?

Yes, there are several famous frontend technology stacks. Here are a few of them:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)
LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
WAMP Stack (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
JAM Stack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup)
Vue.js Stack (Vue.js, Node.js, Nuxt.js, Firebase)

***
is node js any different than javascript

Yes, Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side to build web applications, command-line tools, and even desktop applications. While Node.js is based on JavaScript, it includes additional APIs and features specific to server-side programming, such as the ability to read and write files, interact with databases, and perform network operations. Therefore, while Node.js is based on JavaScript, it is a different technology and ecosystem from client-side JavaScript in the browser.

Deploying a full-stack app to Heroku
Introduction to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)


Week 10: Project work

Building a complete web application using the MERN stack.



-------------


here's a possible schedule for learning JavaScript from basics to advanced:

Week 1: Introduction to JavaScript and the basics (variables, data types, operators, etc.)

Week 2: Control structures (if/else, loops, etc.) and functions

Week 3: Arrays and Objects

Week 4: DOM Manipulation

Week 5: Events and Event Listeners

Week 6: Regular Expressions

Week 7: Debugging and Error Handling

Week 8: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

Week 9: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features and syntax (let/const, arrow functions, classes, etc.)

Week 10: Modular JavaScript and Advanced Topics (closures, promises, async/await, etc.)

Week 11: JavaScript Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js)

Week 12: Server-side JavaScript (Node.js)

This is just a rough outline and the exact duration and depth of each topic can vary depending on your learning pace and goals. You can also adjust the schedule based on your interests and focus more on specific topics that you find more relevant to your projects or career aspirations.
