can you give me a detailed schedule for frontend technologies and before that can you tell me is there any famous stacks in frontend as well if so can you name a few of them?

Yes, there are several famous frontend technology stacks. Here are a few of them:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)
LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
WAMP Stack (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
JAM Stack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup)
Vue.js Stack (Vue.js, Node.js, Nuxt.js, Firebase)

***
is node js any different than javascript

Yes, Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side to build web applications, command-line tools, and even desktop applications. While Node.js is based on JavaScript, it includes additional APIs and features specific to server-side programming, such as the ability to read and write files, interact with databases, and perform network operations. Therefore, while Node.js is based on JavaScript, it is a different technology and ecosystem from client-side JavaScript in the browser.
