The correct syntax for showing the last 5 commits in a single line format is:

`git log --oneline -5`

Notice that there is only one dash (`-`) before the number 5, not two (`--`). 
This is because the number 5 is not a separate option, but a parameter for the `--oneline` option. 
The dash (`-`) indicates that the parameter is optional, and the default value is 10. 
If you want to show more or less than 10 commits, you can specify the number after the dash (`-`). 

For example:

`git log --oneline -20`

This will show the last 20 commits in a single line format. You can also use the `--max-count` option to achieve the same result. For example:

`git log --oneline --max-count=20`

This will also show the last 20 commits in a single line format. 
The `--max-count` option takes an equal sign (`=`) and a number as its parameter. 
You can use either syntax, but the dash (`-`) is shorter and easier to type.
