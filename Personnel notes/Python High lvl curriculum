Here is a high-level curriculum to learn the concepts of Python:

Basics: Data Types, Variables, Operators, Flow control statements, Functions, Input/Output
Data structures: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Strings
Modules and Packages: Importing, Creating and Distributing modules/packages
File I/O and Error Handling: Opening/Reading/Writing files, Exception handling
Object Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
Regular Expressions
Datetime, Calendar and Time module
Database programming: Connecting to databases, SQLite3
Multithreading and Multiprocessing
Decorators and Generators
Advanced Topics: Metaclasses, Context Managers, Iterators, Coroutines, Decorators
Web Development using Flask or Django
Network Programming
Scientific Computing: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Working with XML and JSON data
Testing and Debugging
This is a broad curriculum and there might be some variations based on personal preference and requirement.

It's also important to note that, learning should not be limited to just reading textbooks,
and instead, hands-on coding and practical implementation is crucial for a good understanding of the concepts.



-------------



 here is a suggested schedule for learning all the concepts of Python:

Week 1: Introduction to Python and the basics (variables, data types, operators, etc.)

Week 2: Control structures (if/else, loops, etc.) and functions

Week 3: Modules and libraries

Week 4: Exception handling

Week 5: File handling and CSV (Comma Separated Values) files

Week 6: Classes and Objects

Week 7: Regular Expressions

Week 8: Database Connectivity with SQLite

Week 9: Advanced Topics (decorators, generators, etc.)

Week 10: Project Work (Build a complete Python project)

This schedule is just a suggestion and can be modified to suit your learning pace and availability. 
It is also advisable to continuously practice with small programming exercises and projects to solidify your understanding of the concepts.
