Exactly — saying something like *“I create an instance using the AWS website UI”* sounds too informal and non-technical in an interview because it makes it seem like you only know how to use the graphical interface, not the underlying **platform-level process**.  

Here’s how you can phrase it correctly and confidently to sound professional:

***

### **1. For AWS (EC2 instance creation)**  
Instead of saying *“I create it from the website”*, say:  

> “In AWS, I log into the Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service, and launch an instance by selecting the AMI (operating system image), instance type, key pair for SSH access, storage configuration, and network settings. Once reviewed, I launch the instance and connect via SSH or RDP.”  

If you want to sound more DevOps-fluent:  

> “While I can create instances from the AWS Management Console, I often prefer using the AWS CLI or Terraform to provision EC2 instances for repeatability and automation.”

***

### **2. For Azure (Virtual Machine or App Service creation)**  
Instead of *“I click on the Azure website,”* say:  

> “In Azure, I create a virtual machine from the Azure Portal by selecting the resource group, image type, region, size, authentication method, and networking options, then deploy it. Alternatively, in a DevOps workflow, I use Azure CLI or ARM/Bicep templates for scripted provisioning.”  

Or, if you’re referring to App Service:  

> “For application hosting, instead of creating raw VMs, I use Azure App Service, which is a PaaS environment. I define the runtime stack, region, and App Service plan, then deploy my code either via Azure CLI or directly from a connected repo.”

### **Why this matters**  
- Using words like **“Management Console,” “Portal,” “CLI,” “ARM template,” “Terraform,” or “Provision”** shows you understand platform concepts.  
- Avoid terms like *“website”* or *“clicking”* — they make it sound like you rely on the UI rather than understanding infrastructure provisioning.  
- Showing awareness of automation and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools gives a huge impression of readiness for a DevOps or cloud engineer role.[1][2][3]
