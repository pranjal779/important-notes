A common example of black box testing involves evaluating the login functionality of a web application. In this scenario, the tester interacts with the system as an end-user would, without any knowledge of the internal code structure, database design, or system architecture. [1]  
Example: Login Functionality Test Cases 

• Valid Credentials: 
	• Input: A valid username and a valid password. 
	• Expected Output: Successful login, redirection to the user's dashboard or home page. 

• Invalid Username, Valid Password: 
	• Input: An invalid (non-existent) username and a valid password. 
	• Expected Output: An error message indicating incorrect credentials (e.g., "Invalid username or password"). 

• Valid Username, Invalid Password: 
	• Input: A valid username and an invalid password. 
	• Expected Output: An error message indicating incorrect credentials. 

• Empty Username, Empty Password: 
	• Input: Leaving both username and password fields empty. 
	• Expected Output: Error messages prompting the user to enter credentials for both fields. 

• SQL Injection Attempt: 
	• Input: Malicious SQL code in the username or password field (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --). 
	• Expected Output: The system should prevent the injection and handle the input securely, ideally by rejecting the login attempt and logging the suspicious activity. 

• Case Sensitivity: 
	• Input: A valid username with incorrect capitalization (e.g., "Username" instead of "username") and a valid password. 
	• Expected Output: Depending on the system's design, either successful login (if case-insensitive) or an error message (if case-sensitive). 

In this example, the tester's focus is solely on the external behavior of the system – what goes in and what comes out – without concern for the "black box" of internal operations.
