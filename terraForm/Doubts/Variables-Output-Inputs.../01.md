There are a couple of corrections needed in your Terraform configuration:

1. The `type` attribute should not be capitalized, and it should be assigned with the data type `list(any)`.

2. You should separate the attributes of the variable using commas (`,`) instead of semicolons (`;`).

Here's the corrected version:

```hcl
variable "sample_aws_ec2_ip" {
  type = list(any)
}

output "list_of_EC2_IPs" {
  value = var.sample_aws_ec2_ip
}
```

In this corrected version:

- The variable `sample_aws_ec2_ip` is declared as a list of any type, indicating that it will hold a list of values of any type.
- The output block named "list_of_EC2_IPs" exposes the value of the `sample_aws_ec2_ip` variable when you run `terraform apply`. 

You can indeed name the output whatever you want. Output names are not tied to any specific resource name. They are simply used to identify and access the output values from the Terraform state. 

Remember to replace `"sample_aws_ec2_ip"` with the actual name of your variable, and adjust the output name according to your preference.
