The `-out` option in Terraform is used to specify the **path to a file** where Terraform will save the execution plan. This plan file contains information about the changes that Terraform will apply to your infrastructure. Let's break down the syntax and usage of the `-out` option:

1. **Syntax**:
   - When running `terraform plan`, you can use the `-out` option followed by the path to the output file. For example:
     ```
     terraform plan -out=my-plan.tfplan
     ```
   - In this example, `my-plan.tfplan` is the name of the file where Terraform will save the execution plan.

2. **Usage**:
   - The `-out` option is typically used in conjunction with `terraform apply`. After creating an execution plan using `terraform plan`, you can apply the changes by running:
     ```
     terraform apply my-plan.tfplan
     ```
   - This ensures that Terraform applies the same set of changes that were planned earlier.

3. **Example**:
   - Suppose you have a Terraform configuration that defines an AWS S3 bucket. After running `terraform plan`, you'll see the planned changes. To apply those changes using the saved plan file, use:
     ```
     terraform apply my-plan.tfplan
     ```
   - Terraform will then create or update the resources based on the plan stored in `my-plan.tfplan`.

Remember that the `-out` option allows you to save the execution plan to a file, making it easier to apply the same set of changes consistently. ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒŸ
