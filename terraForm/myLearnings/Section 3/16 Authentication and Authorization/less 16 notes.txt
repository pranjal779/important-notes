Now whenever you go ahead and create token, now we know that TerraForm requires a token when it comes

to GitHub.

So whenever you go ahead and you create a new token, you can specify what are the permissions that

a token has, whether it has permissions or all repository or only selected repository.

And on that selected repository also you can specify for which feature what is the access pattern that

it has.

So discussion might have read and write access.

The pulled request might have no access and so on.

So again, depending upon what you want to create and manage through TerraForm, you can go ahead and

create the appropriate credentials with proper permissions.

So that's a very high level overview about the authentication and authorization stages.
