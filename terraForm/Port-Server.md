An **FTP port** is a communication endpoint used by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files between a client and a server over a network. The standard FTP port number is **21**, which is used for command and control messages, while port **20** is used for actual data transfer¹².

An **FTP server**, on the other hand, is computer software that allows for the transfer of files between a server and a client using the FTP protocol. It operates on a client-server model and can handle commands such as sending, receiving, and deleting files, as well as creating or removing directories⁵⁶. FTP servers can be secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for secure transmission¹.

FTP is a long-established protocol, originally defined in 1971, and it's been a fundamental tool for file transfer in the internet's history. However, due to security concerns, modern usage often prefers more secure variants like FTPS or SFTP¹².
