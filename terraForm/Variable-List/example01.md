In Terraform, a list is a sequence of values that are identified by consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero. Here's an example of how you can define and use a list data type in Terraform:

```hcl
variable "availability_zones" {
  description = "A list of availability zones"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count         = length(var.availability_zones)
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  availability_zone = var.availability_zones[count.index]
}
```

In this example:
- We define a variable `availability_zones` of type `list(string)` with a default value of two availability zones¹.
- We then create multiple instances of `aws_instance` using the `count` attribute, which is set to the length of our `availability_zones` list.
- Each instance is assigned an `availability_zone` from the list based on the `count.index`.

This is a basic example to get you started with lists in Terraform. You can find more complex examples and detailed explanations in the Terraform documentation¹.
