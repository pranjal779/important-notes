Learn D3.js  

<script src="js/d3/d3.v5.min.js"></script>  
You can place the <script> tag in the <head> or <body> section of your HTML document, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load.  
The <script> tag contains JavaScript code that is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.  


D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating HTML based on data. You can also use the JavaScript console to see error messages, navigate a static page structure, interact with data, and test code fragments and examples.
