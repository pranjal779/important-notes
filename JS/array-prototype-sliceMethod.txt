 Array.prototype.slice()

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice


The slice() method of Array instances returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) 
where start and end represent the index of items in that array. 
The original array will not be modified.
