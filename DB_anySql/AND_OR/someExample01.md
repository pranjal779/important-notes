```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
```

and

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
```

-----------

The difference between the two SQL queries lies in the application of logical operators, particularly in how they group conditions.

1. In the first query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
```
This query applies the `AND` operator first. It retrieves rows where the country is 'Spain' and either the customer name starts with 'G' or the customer name starts with 'R'. 
However, due to the precedence of logical operators, the `AND` condition is evaluated before the `OR` condition, so it applies to both conditions separately.

2. In the second query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
```
This query uses parentheses to group the `OR` conditions together. As a result, the `AND` condition applies to the combined result of the `OR` conditions. 
It retrieves rows where the country is 'Spain' and the customer name starts with either 'G' or 'R'.

In summary, the first query applies the `AND` condition separately to each `LIKE` condition, while the second query groups the `LIKE` conditions together, and the `AND` condition applies to the combined result of the grouped `LIKE` conditions. 
Depending on the desired logic, the results of the two queries may differ.

Let's assume we have the following sample data in the `Customers` table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | Country |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 1          | Alice        | Spain   |
| 2          | Bob          | Spain   |
| 3          | Carol        | Spain   |
| 4          | David        | Spain   |
| 5          | Richard      | Spain   |
| 6          | Gary         | Spain   |
| 7          | Rachel       | Spain   |
| 8          | Emily        | USA     |
| 9          | George       | Spain   |
| 10         | Robert       | Spain   |

Now, let's apply each query to this dataset:

1. First Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
```
This query retrieves rows where the country is 'Spain' and either the customer name starts with 'G' or the customer name starts with 'R'.

The result of this query would be:
| CustomerID | CustomerName | Country |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 5          | Richard      | Spain   |
| 6          | Gary         | Spain   |
| 7          | Rachel       | Spain   |
| 9          | George       | Spain   |
| 10         | Robert       | Spain   |

2. Second Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
```
This query retrieves rows where the country is 'Spain' and the customer name starts with either 'G' or 'R'.

The result of this query would be:
| CustomerID | CustomerName | Country |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 5          | Richard      | Spain   |
| 6          | Gary         | Spain   |
| 7          | Rachel       | Spain   |
| 9          | George       | Spain   |
| 10         | Robert       | Spain   |

As you can see, in this particular dataset, the results of both queries are the same because all customers from Spain whose names start with 'G' or 'R' are the same in this example. 
However, in a larger dataset with more diverse data, the results may differ depending on how the conditions are grouped.
