Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), delivered as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources themselves, allowing them to pay only for what they use1. In simpler terms, cloud computing uses a network (most often, the internet) to connect users to a cloud platform where they request and access rented computing services. A central server handles all the communication between client devices and servers to facilitate the exchange of data. Security and privacy features are common components to keep this information secure and safe. There are three different cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud
