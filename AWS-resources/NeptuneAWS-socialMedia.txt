Amazon Neptune is highly available, with read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across Availability Zones. 
Neptune is secure with support for HTTPS encrypted client connections and encryption at rest.

Amazon Neptune can quickly and easily process large sets of user-profiles and interactions to build social networking applications. 
Neptune enables highly interactive graph queries with high throughput to bring social features into your applications. 
For example, if you are building a social feed into your application, you can use Neptune to provide results that prioritize showing your users 
the latest updates from their family, from friends whose updates they ‘Like,’ and from friends who live close to them.
