**Amazon S3 Object Lock**

Amazon S3 Object Lock is an Amazon S3 feature that allows you to store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model. 
You can use WORM protection for scenarios where it is imperative that data is not changed or deleted after it has been written. 
Whether your business has a requirement to satisfy compliance regulations in the financial or healthcare sector, or you simply want to capture a golden copy of business records for later auditing and reconciliation, 
Amazon S3 Object Lock is the right tool for you. 
Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
