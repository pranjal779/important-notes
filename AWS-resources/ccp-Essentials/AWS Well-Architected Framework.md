# The AWS Well-Architected Framework

The [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.

The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars: 

Operational excellence
Security
Reliability
Performance efficiency
Cost optimization
Sustainability
To learn more, expand each of the following six categories.


Operational excellence
–
Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  



Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.


Security
–
The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 



When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:

Automate security best practices when possible.
Apply security at all layers.
Protect data in transit and at rest.

Reliability
–
Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:

Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.


Performance efficiency
–
Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 



Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.


Cost optimization
–
Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 



Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.


Sustainability
–
In December 2021, AWS introduced a sustainability pillar as part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.



Sustainability is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.



To facilitate good design for sustainability:

Understand your impact

Establish sustainability goals

Maximize utilization

Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings

Use managed services

Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads

Which of the following principles align with the AWS Well-Architected Framework for cloud architecture design? Select all that apply.

Ensuring system scalability

SELECTED
Scalability is a fundamental principle of cloud design recommended by AWS. It refers to the ability of a system to handle increases in load by adjusting resources, either through scaling up (adding more resources to an existing system) or scaling out (adding more instances of resources). This principle ensures that applications can maintain performance and availability as demand changes, which is central to the AWS cloud's value proposition of providing flexible and efficient computing resources.

Prioritizing monolithic architectures

This option is incorrect within the context of AWS's recommended cloud design principles. AWS and the AWS Well-Architected Framework advocate for architectures that are modular, scalable, and can evolve over time. Monolithic architectures, where the application is tightly integrated and deployed as a single unit, contrast with these principles. They can lead to challenges in scaling, updating, and maintaining the application. AWS encourages the use of microservices architecture, which involves breaking down applications into smaller, independent components that communicate over well-defined interfaces. This approach offers better scalability, reliability, and deployment flexibility, making it more aligned with cloud-native design practices.

Managing infrastructure through code

SELECTED
This option is correct because Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key practice recommended by AWS for automating and managing the cloud infrastructure. IaC allows for the provisioning and management of infrastructure using code and templates, which improves consistency, reduces the potential for human error, and enables the rapid deployment of infrastructure changes. This practice supports the AWS Well-Architected Framework by promoting operational excellence and reliability.

Design for failure

SELECTED
Designing for failure is correct and crucial in cloud architecture as it acknowledges that failures will occur and focuses on creating systems that are resilient and can recover gracefully. This principle aligns with the AWS recommendation to build reliable and fault-tolerant systems by using services that are designed to be highly available and by implementing strategies such as replication, backups, and failover mechanisms. This approach ensures that systems can continue to operate and maintain data integrity despite component failures.

Tightly-coupled components

This option is incorrect. Tightly coupled systems can become bottlenecks in cloud environments, where the ability to rapidly adapt to changing demands and to deploy new features quickly is crucial.

Use of ephemeral resources

SELECTED
This principle is correct because it emphasizes the cloud's ability to provide resources that can be temporarily provisioned and easily disposed of, aligning with the AWS cloud's elasticity and cost management strategies. Ephemeral resources support scalability and cost-efficiency, allowing for the dynamic allocation and deallocation of resources based on demand. This approach reduces waste and ensures that resources are consumed judiciously, in line with AWS's recommendation to optimize for cost and performance.
