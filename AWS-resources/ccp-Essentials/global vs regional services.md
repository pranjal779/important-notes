In **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, services can be categorized as either _global_ or _regional_ or _Availability Zone (AZ)_ specific.. Let me break it down for you:

1) **Global Services:**
These services are **not tied to a specific region** and operate globally. Examples include:
- **AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Manages user access and permissions.
- **Amazon CloudFront:** A content delivery network (CDN) for faster content distribution.
- **Amazon Route 53:** A scalable domain name system (DNS) service.
- **AWS Global Accelerator:** Improves availability and performance for applications.
- **AWS Direct Connect:** Establishes dedicated network connections.
- **AWS Firewall Manager:** Centralized security management.
- **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects web applications from attacks.
- **AWS Shield:** DDoS protection.

2) **Regional Services:**
These services are specific to a particular AWS region. They process and store customer content within that region. Examples include:
- **Amazon EC2:** Elastic Compute Cloud instances.
- **Amazon RDS:** Relational Database Service.
- **Amazon S3:** Simple Storage Service.
- **Amazon Lambda:** Serverless compute service.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Managed NoSQL database.  
And many more!
