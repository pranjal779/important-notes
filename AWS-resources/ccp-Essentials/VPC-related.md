Thank you for sharing the additional image. The image you provided shows the limits related to **VPC Subnet Sharing** and not directly about **Route Tables per VPC**.

Here’s what’s shown in your image:

- **Participant accounts per VPC**: The maximum number of distinct participant accounts that subnets in a VPC can be associated with is 100.
- **Subnets that can be shared with an account**: The maximum number of subnets that can be shared with an AWS account is 100.

These are different limits and are not directly related to the route tables per VPC.

To clarify:

- **Route Tables per VPC**: The correct limit for this is 100 by default.
- **Subnets per VPC**: As you saw in your previous image, this limit is 200 by default.
- **VPC Subnet Sharing**: This deals with the number of subnets that can be shared and the number of participant accounts, with a limit of 100 for both.

If your practice question was asking about the number of route tables per VPC, the correct answer would be 100 (option A in your previous list). The image you shared now is related to subnet sharing, which is a different concept.

I hope this clears up the confusion!
