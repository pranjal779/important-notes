There's so much more that can be done on AWS that we have time to talk about here. For example, when it comes to migrating onto AWS, we didn't even cover running VMware on AWS. The same VMware based infrastructure that you use on prem can in many cases, just be lifted up and dropped onto AWS via VMware Cloud on AWS. And this is just one of many concepts that make AWS a place where builders go to create and innovate at the pace of their ideas. 



When it comes to machine learning and artificial intelligence, AWS has the broadest and deepest set of machine learning and AI services for your business. You can choose from pre-trained AI services for computer vision, language recommendations, and forecasting. Amazon SageMaker: Quickly build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. 



Or build custom models with support for all the popular open-source frameworks. Our capabilities are built on the most comprehensive cloud platform, optimized for machine learning with high performance compute and no compromises on security and analytics. Tools like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Augmented AI, or Amazon A2I, provide a machine learning platform that any business can build upon without needing PhD level expertise in-house. Or perhaps, ready-to-go AI solutions like Amazon Lex, the heart of Alexa.


[Alexa] Hello . What can I help you with?


Helps you build interactive chat bots.



Or what about Amazon Textract. Extracting text and data from documents to make them more usable for your enterprise instead of them just being locked away in a repository. 



Do you wanna put machine learning literally into the hands of your developers? Why not try AWS DeepRacer? A chance for your developers to experiment with reinforcement learning. One of the newest branches of machine learning algorithms, all while having fun in a racing environment. 



AWS offers brand new technologies in things like Internet of Things. Enabling connected devices to communicate all around the world. 



Speaking of communication around the world, have you ever wanted to have your own satellite? Too expensive to launch your own? Why not just use AWS Ground Station and only pay for the satellite time you actually need? 



I could go on for days talking about all these new technologies. Like literally for days. AWS Training and Certification offers training classes on many of these technologies already, and every month, AWS seems to release something even better for us to talk about.

Innovate with AWS Services

When examining how to use AWS services, it is important to focus on the desired outcomes. You are properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: 

The current state
The desired state
The problems you are trying to solve
Consider some of the paths you might explore in the future as you continue on your cloud journey. 

To learn more on ways to innovate with AWS, expand each of the following three categories.


Serverless applications
–
With AWS, serverless refers to applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers. You don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability. AWS handles these capabilities for you.



AWS Lambda is an example of a service that you can use to run serverless applications. If you design your architecture to trigger Lambda functions to run your code, you can bypass the need to manage a fleet of servers.



Building your architecture with serverless applications enables your developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.


Artificial intelligence
–
AWS offers a variety of services powered by artificial intelligence (AI). 



For example, you can perform the following tasks:

Convert speech to text with Amazon Transcribe.
Discover patterns in text with Amazon Comprehend.
Identify potentially fraudulent online activities with Amazon Fraud Detector.
Build voice and text chatbots with Amazon Lex.

Machine learning
–
Traditional machine learning (ML) development is complex, expensive, time consuming, and error prone. AWS offers Amazon SageMaker to remove the difficult work from the process and empower you to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.



You can use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen.
