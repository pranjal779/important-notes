# AWS Support

AWS offers four different Support plans(opens in a new tab) to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services. 

You can choose from the following Support plans to meet your company’s needs: 

Basic
Developer
Business
Enterprise On-Ramp
Enterprise

## Basic Support

**Basic Support** is free for all AWS customers. It includes access to whitepapers, documentation, and support communities. With Basic Support, you can also contact AWS for billing questions and service limit increases.

With Basic Support, you have access to a limited selection of AWS Trusted Advisor checks. Additionally, you can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard, a tool that provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you. 

If your company needs support beyond the Basic level, you could consider purchasing Developer, Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support.

Developer, Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support

The Developer, Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support plans include all the benefits of Basic Support, in addition to the ability to open an unrestricted number of technical support cases. These Support plans have pay-by-the-month pricing and require no long-term contracts.

The information in this course highlights only a selection of details for each Support plan. A complete overview of what is included in each Support plan, including pricing for each plan, is available on the AWS Support(opens in a new tab) site.

In general, for pricing, the Developer plan has the lowest cost, the Business and Enterprise On-Ramp plans are in the middle, and the Enterprise plan has the highest cost.

To learn more about AWS support plans, expand each of the following four categories.


## Developer Support
–
Customers in the Developer Support plan have access to features such as:

Best practice guidance
Client-side diagnostic tools
Building-block architecture support, which consists of guidance for how to use AWS offerings, features, and services together
For example, suppose that your company is exploring AWS services. You’ve heard about a few different AWS services. However, you’re unsure of how to potentially use them together to build applications that can address your company’s needs. In this scenario, the building-block architecture support that is included with the Developer Support plan could help you to identify opportunities for combining specific services and features.


## Business Support
–
Customers with a Business Support plan have access to additional features, including: 

Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs
All AWS Trusted Advisor checks
Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components
Suppose that your company has the Business Support plan and wants to install a common third-party operating system onto your Amazon EC2 instances. You could contact AWS Support for assistance with installing, configuring, and troubleshooting the operating system. For advanced topics such as optimizing performance, using custom scripts, or resolving security issues, you may need to contact the third-party software provider directly.


## Enterprise On-Ramp Support
–
In November 2021, AWS opened enrollment into AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan. In addition to all the features included in the Basic, Developer, and Business Support plans, customers with an Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan have access to:

A pool of Technical Account Managers to provide proactive guidance and coordinate access to programs and AWS experts

A Cost Optimization workshop (one per year)

A Concierge support team for billing and account assistance

Tools to monitor costs and performance through Trusted Advisor and Health API/Dashboard

Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan also provides access to a specific set of proactive support services, which are provided by a pool of Technical Account Managers.

Consultative review and architecture guidance (one per year)

Infrastructure Event Management support (one per year)

Support automation workflows

30 minutes or less response time for business-critical issues


## Enterprise Support
–
In addition to all features included in the Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise On-Ramp support plans, customers with Enterprise Support have access to:

A designated Technical Account Manager to provide proactive guidance and coordinate access to programs and AWS experts

A Concierge support team for billing and account assistance

Operations Reviews and tools to monitor health

Training and Game Days to drive innovation

Tools to monitor costs and performance through Trusted Advisor and Health API/Dashboard

The Enterprise plan also provides full access to proactive services, which are provided by a designated Technical Account Manager:

Consultative review and architecture guidance

Infrastructure Event Management support

Cost Optimization Workshop and tools

Support automation workflows

15 minutes or less response time for business-critical issues

Technical Account Manager (TAM)

The Enterprise On-Ramp and Enterprise Support plans include access to a Technical Account Manager (TAM).

The TAM is your primary point of contact at AWS. If your company subscribes to Enterprise Support or Enterprise On-Ramp, your TAM educates, empowers, and evolves your cloud journey across the full range of AWS services. TAMs provide expert engineering guidance, help you design solutions that efficiently integrate AWS services, assist with cost-effective and resilient architectures, and provide direct access to AWS programs and a broad community of experts.

For example, suppose that you are interested in developing an application that uses several AWS services together. Your TAM could provide insights into how to best use the services together. They achieve this, while aligning with the specific needs that your company is hoping to address through the new application.
