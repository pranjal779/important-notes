You have been assigned to design a new Amazon RDS database for a pharmaceutical company. Their most important requirement is high availability. You have proposed a multi AZ configuration for high availability. This the discussion has progressed to failovers scenarios, which scenarios will not cause a automatic failover question, mark. 

Option 1) loss of availability in the primary database availability zone. 
Option 2), a compute unit, failure on a primary database instance, 
Option 3), a long-running resource-intensive, stored procedure on the primary DB. 
Option. 4), loss of network connectivity to primary DB instance. 

Ans -> 3
Explanation. 

Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failures scenarios for multi-az deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. 
Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any, of the following: 
1) loss of availability in primary availability zone 
2) loss of network connectivity to primary
3) compute, unit failure, on primary
4) storage failure on primary, 


Aurora Replicas
Aurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. 
That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.

While setting up a Multi-AZ deployment for Aurora, you create an Aurora replica or reader node in a different AZ.
