Amazon EMR (previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce) is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, 
such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. 
Using these frameworks and related open-source projects, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. 
Amazon EMR also lets you transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases, 
such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

Kinesis Data Streams
 -> Kinesis Data Streams are scaled using the concept of a shard. One shard provides an ingest capacity of 1MB/second or 1000 records/second and an output capacity of 2MB/second. Itâ€™s not uncommon for customers to have thousands or tens of thousands of shards supporting 10s of GB/sec of ingest and egress.
