failover scenarios
Amazon RDS
You have been assigned to design a new Amazon RDS database for a pharmaceutical company. Their most important requirement is high availability. You have proposed a multi AZ configuration for high availability. This the discussion has progressed to failovers scenarios, which scenarios will not cause a automatic failover question, mark. 

Option 1) loss of availability in the primary database availability zone. 
Option 2), a compute unit, failure on a primary database instance, 
Option 3), a long-running resource-intensive, stored procedure on the primary DB. 
Option. 4), loss of network connectivity to primary DB instance. 

Ans -> 3
Explanation. 

Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failures scenarios for multi-az deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any, of the following. 
1) loss of availability in primary availability zone 
2) loss of network connectivity to primary
3) compute, unit failure, on primary
4) storage failure on primary,

AWS MangedIPSec VPN Connection

Q12:
AWS Managed IPSec VPN Connection between their remote on-premises network and their Amazon VPC over the internet.

Virtual private gateway: A Virtual Private Gateway (also known as a VPN Gateway) is the endpoint on the AWS VPC side of your VPN connection.

VPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.

VPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.

Customer Gateway: An AWS resource that provides information to AWS about your Customer Gateway device.

Customer Gateway device: A physical device or software application on the customer side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection


Use AWS Global Accelerator - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. 
It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, 
such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, 
such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, 
fast regional failover. Since CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic, so this option is ruled out.

Use AWS Direct Connect - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. 
Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. 
AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. 
Direct Connect cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.

AWS Direct Connect connection to the AWS VPC

VPC Endpoint
 AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet.

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. 
VPC peering facilitates a connection between two VPCs within the AWS network, therefore this option cannot be used to send 
and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.

Copy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync command
The aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between S3 buckets.

Set up S3 batch replication to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console

User Data is generally used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you can pass two types of user data - shell scripts and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the launch wizard as plain text or as a file.

By default, user data is executed every time an EC2 instance is re-started - As discussed above, this is not a default configuration of the system. But, can be achieved by explicitly configuring the instance.


What does VIF stand for in AWS?
A virtual interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, and is either public or private. A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3. A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC.

the Amazon EFS API


Data Transfer Out (DTO) from AWS to the on-premises data center. DTO refers to the cumulative network traffic that is sent through AWS Direct Connect to destinations outside of AWS. This is charged per gigabyte (GB), and unlike capacity measurements, DTO refers to the amount of data transferred, not the speed.

Use Amazon Cognito User Pools - A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. You can leverage Amazon Cognito User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).

User pools provide: 1. Sign-up and sign-in services. 2. A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users. 3. Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as sign-in with SAML identity providers from your user pool. 4. User directory management and user profiles. 5. Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification. 6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.

After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer that uses the user pool.


AWS DMS supports Amazon S3 as the source and Kinesis as the target, so data stored in an S3 bucket is streamed to Kinesis. Several consumers, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, and the Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL), can consume the data concurrently to perform real-time analytics on the dataset. Each AWS service in this architecture can scale independently as needed.
