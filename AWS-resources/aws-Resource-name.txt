DAX cluster
cache eviction rate
 --> When a DAX cluster has a high amount of cache misses and writes, using larger node types can improve write performance.

Amazon EC2
Amazon EKS supports CRI-O containers with an open-source container orchestration service, and provide the right balance of flexibility and AWS management
AWS Fargate would not allow the same level of customization and flexibility.
Amazon ECS does not offer a proprietary container orchestration service.
Amazon EC2 instances would not provide any level of managing the host instances. in the case where containers are involved.

failover scenarios
Amazon RDS
You have been assigned to design a new Amazon RDS database for a pharmaceutical company. Their most important requirement is high availability. You have proposed a multi AZ configuration for high availability. This the discussion has progressed to failovers scenarios, which scenarios will not cause a automatic failover question, mark. 

Option 1) loss of availability in the primary database availability zone. 
Option 2), a compute unit, failure on a primary database instance, 
Option 3), a long-running resource-intensive, stored procedure on the primary DB. 
Option. 4), loss of network connectivity to primary DB instance. 

Ans -> 3
Explanation. 

Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failures scenarios for multi-az deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any, of the following. 
1) loss of availability in primary availability zone 
2) loss of network connectivity to primary
3) compute, unit failure, on primary
4) storage failure on primary,
