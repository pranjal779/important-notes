Q
An application is hosted on multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone (AZ). 
The engineering team wants to set up shared data access for these Amazon EC2 instances using Amazon EBS Multi-Attach volumes.

Which Amazon EBS volume type is the correct choice for these Amazon EC2 instances?

Explanation
Correct option:

Provisioned IOPS SSD Amazon EBS volumes

Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone. You can attach multiple Multi-Attach enabled volumes to an instance or set of instances. Each instance to which the volume is attached has full read and write permission to the shared volume. Multi-Attach makes it easier for you to achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications that manage concurrent write operations.

Multi-Attach is supported exclusively on Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes.

Incorrect options:

General-purpose SSD-based Amazon EBS volumes - These SSD-backed Amazon EBS volumes provide a balance of price and performance. AWS recommends these volumes for most workloads. These volume types are not supported for Multi-Attach functionality.

Throughput Optimized HDD Amazon EBS volumes - These HDD-backed volumes provide a low-cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads. These volume types are not supported for Multi-Attach functionality.

Cold HDD Amazon EBS volumes - These HDD-backed volumes provide a lowest-cost HDD design for less frequently accessed workloads. These volume types are not supported for Multi-Attach functionality.
