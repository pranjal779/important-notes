What is AWS Direct Connect?

AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS. 
Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a private network connection between your facilities and AWS. 
In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. 
All AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon DynamoDB 
can be used with AWS Direct Connect.

Data Transfer Out (DTO) from AWS to the on-premises data center. 
DTO refers to the cumulative network traffic that is sent through AWS Direct Connect to destinations outside of AWS. 
This is charged per gigabyte (GB), and unlike capacity measurements, DTO refers to the amount of data transferred, not the speed.
