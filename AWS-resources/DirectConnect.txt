What is AWS Direct Connect?

AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS. 
Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a private network connection between your facilities and AWS. 
In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. 
All AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon DynamoDB 
can be used with AWS Direct Connect.

Data Transfer Out (DTO) from AWS to the on-premises data center. 
DTO refers to the cumulative network traffic that is sent through AWS Direct Connect to destinations outside of AWS. 
This is charged per gigabyte (GB), and unlike capacity measurements, DTO refers to the amount of data transferred, not the speed.

Q
To support critical production workloads that require maximum resiliency, a company wants to configure network connections between its Amazon VPC and the on-premises infrastructure. The company needs AWS Direct Connect connections with speeds greater than 1 Gbps.

As a solutions architect, which of the following will you suggest as the best architecture for this requirement?

Opt for two separate AWS Direct Connect connections terminating on separate devices in more than one Direct Connect location

Maximum resilience is achieved by separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one location. This configuration offers customers maximum resilience to failure. As shown in the figure above, such a topology provides resilience to device failure, connectivity failure, and complete location failure. You can use Direct Connect Gateway to access any AWS Region (except AWS Regions in China) from any AWS Direct Connect locations.
